## Problem Statement

The dashboard helps to generate the insights of hotel industry with the available sample data. This dashboard helps to make us understand about various parameters and variables that are used in the hotel industry and provide good insights related to overall hotel performances and revenue based on city and hotels.

# Steps followed for making main dashboard

1. Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is in the 5 csv files.
2. Open power query editor and perform necessary tranformation.
   - dim_date
     - Add day_no column to extract the day number from 1 to 7 based on the date which would be useful to determine the day_type.
     - Change day_type because in hotel industry weekend is consised on friday & saturday.
     - Format all columns as per the data type.

3. Data Modelling
   - Link the tables with each other to create the relation between them based on the concept of primary and foreign key to make data suitable for analysis.
     - dim_hotels(property_id) --> fact_aggregated_bookings(property_id)
     - dim_hotels(property_id) --> fact_bookings(property_id)
     - dim_date(date) --> fact_bookings(check_in_date)
     - dim_date(date) --> fact_aggregated_bookings(check_in_date)
     - fact_bookings(room_category) --> dim_rooms(room_id)
     - fact_aggregated_bookings(room_category) --> dim_room(room_id)

4. Created a new table which will store all the necessary key measures which I created using available data. To perform the analysis I created almost 26 new measures which I mentioned in a excel file (metrics_list). These measures are created using DAX expressions.

     
       
5. Visual filters (Slicers) were added for seven fields named "City", "Room Class", "Booking Platform", "Day Type", "Hotel Category", "Month", "Week Number".
6. Six card visuals were added to the canvas, representing Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, Realisation %, DSRN, RevPAR and below every card added a table where cell element is used in the form of arrows and value will be used to distinguish the form of increasement , decreasement or equal values to describe the changes over week to week. <p> </p>

7. Other visuals added are donut chart, line chart, tables.
8. Used tooltip on these cards to describe more about these cards.


# Other pages
Some other pages was also made which will act as a tootlip page for the respective card visuals of main dashboard. <p> </p>

In above snap, the arrow is the main visual for which tooltip is active therefore when we will over the cursor to that particular visual we will get that detailed additional chart which is set as a tooltip page for that visual ( here visual with 'T' doodle is a tooltip page )

# Secondary Dashboard
For doing detailed analysis, created a secondary dashboard which covers more insights related to data itself. <p> </p>
