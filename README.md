# Steps followed 

1. Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is in the 5 csv files.
2. Open power query editor and perform necessary tranformation.
   - dim_date
     - Add day_no column to extract the day number from 1 to 7 based on the date which would be useful to determine the day_type.
     - Change day_type because in hotel industry weekend is consised on friday & saturday.
     - Format all columns as per the data type.

3. Data Modelling
   - Link the tables with each other to create the relation between them based on the concept of primary and foreign key to make data suitable for analysis.
     - dim_hotels(property_id) --> fact_aggregated_bookings(property_id)
     - dim_hotels(property_id) --> fact_bookings(property_id)
     - dim_date(date) --> fact_bookings(check_in_date)
     - dim_date(date) --> fact_aggregated_bookings(check_in_date)
     - fact_bookings(room_category) --> dim_rooms(room_id)
     - fact_aggregated_bookings(room_category) --> dim_room(room_id)

4. Visual filters (Slicers) were added for seven fields named "City", "Room Class", "Booking Platform", "Day Type", "Hotel Category", "Month", "Week Number".
5. Six card visuals were added to the canvas, representing Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, Realisation %, DSRN, RevPAR and below every card added a table where cell element is used in the form of arrows and value will be used to distinguish the form of increasement , decreasement or equal values to describe the changes over week to week. <p> </p>

7. Other visuals added are donut chart, line chart, tables.
8. Used tooltip on these cards to describe more about these cards.
           


## Calculated Measures 
       
        Age Group = 
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
        
        "75-100 (100 included)")))

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Total Number of Customers = 129880

   Number of satisfied Customers (Male) = 28159 (21.68 %)

   Number of satisfied Customers (Female) = 28269 (21.76 %)

   Number of neutral/unsatisfied customers (Male) = 35822 (27.58 %)

   Number of neutral/unsatisfied customers (Female) = 37630 (28.97 %)


           thus, higher number of customers are neutral/unsatisfied.
           
### [2] Average Ratings
